## Fast Grid Loading


</div>

### Description

Searching and Browsing is among most common task for database application.

fast search is definitely is a must for good database application,

specially application with high transaction load like Point of Sales.

i use this because i have difficulty in displaying data to user fastly,

at first time i use grid by bound it to recordset and did not notice that it is

only displaying +/- 2000 record until my customer tell me that it is did not show

all the data ( what a good programmer :) ).

then i search msdn and found that it is ms hflexgrid limitation ( WOW ). and i

start to use the clip function just like msdn told me to. and my customer say

"i wonder why yours is slower than my foxpro program", i reply "because foxpro

only display data page by page because foxpro procedural programming", "why dont

you display it like foxpro" he ask again.

that is the story of good programmer :) who learn from good non programmer.

hope it is usefull for you.
